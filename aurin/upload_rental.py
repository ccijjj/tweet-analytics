# It is generally accepted that if housing costs exceed 30% of a low-income household's gross income, the household is experiencing 
# housing stress (30/40 rule). That is, housing is unaffordable and housing costs consume a disproportionately high amount of household
# income. The RAI uses the 30 per cent of income rule. Rental affordability is calculated using the following equation, where 'qualifying 
# income' refers to the household income required to pay rent where rent is equal to 30% of income:
# 
# RAI = (Median income âˆ• Qualifying Income) x 100
# 
# In the RAI, households who are paying 30% of income on rent have a score of 100, indicating that these households are at the critical 
# threshold for housing stress. A score of 100 or less indicates that households would pay more than 30% of income to access a rental 
# dwelling, meaning they are at risk of experiencing housing stress.
# 
# The RAI is a price index for housing rental markets. It is a clear and concise indicator of rental affordability relative to household 
# incomes, applied to geographic areas across Australia.
